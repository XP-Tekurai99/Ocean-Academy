## Private User Data.
The potential of the unstructured and unshared data of individuals is huge.
Think about all those mobile phone users who have hundreds of pictures that could be used to train algorithms.
Currently, this data is not monetized, but it would have value if it was aggregated.

Trust in third parties. Selling personal private data nowadays requires to trust third parties to protect the data from abuse.
Not all third parties have the will or the skills to effectively secure user data.
But even big organizations have a history of data breaches, and cases of mishandling of user data are far too common, even today.

## User Data Ownership.
In the Web3 model, the control of the data is in the hands of the user. The data itself is not owned by the company providing a service anymore. Individuals control and can provide access to their data without worrying about losing ownership and privacy. Individuals can earn a revenue from their data and decide exactly what data is shared, to whom, and how. It also gives individuals visibility of how their data is accessed and used by apps, services and companies.

## Incentivized Data Sharing.
The Web3 model offers users much greater incentives to share their data because it's safe to do so. It makes it difficult for companies to lock-in their users since the data is in the hands of the user. The user can switch to other service providers without losing any data, which can stir healthy competition and innovation across industries.

## Illustrating How it Works with a Web3 Chat App.
Suppose you saved your contact information (e.g. email, name, image, address, etc.) on your mobile phone. Now you want to use a chat app to interact with your friends. You download a chat app with the interface that you like the most and it asks to access additional information like your profile image. While these fields may be optional, they help to improve the user experience.
An app provider would only need to ask for a unique ID and save it into its database. As long as the app follows open standards it is just a User Interface to enable chatting. Chatting can be done in a peer-to-peer way while all data is saved on the user's mobile phone. If you do not like the app you could easily switch to a new app/User Interface while keeping the data (your chats) already collected in the previous app.

## Monetizing Private Data.
Chat users can sell their chat data if they want to. Imagine a company that wants to analyze topics diffusion in private chats over time. Chat users could sell a wordlist and/or word count frequencies from one or more of their conversations and earn money. So it is not the chat app that has a monopoly over this data, it is the user who is in control. This puts the chat app in competition with other analytic service providers. A clever chat app provider would offer their users a payment or other kinds of advantages if users allow them to analyze their chats. The app would move from an ad-based business model to a data-based business model.

Web3 forces companies to offer these kinds of incentives, because there is finally an open market around user generated data where the user is in control.
