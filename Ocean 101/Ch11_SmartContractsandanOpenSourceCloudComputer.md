# Chapter 11: Smart Contracts and an Open Source Cloud Computer

## Centralized Computing
AI is mostly trained on the cloud. Home computers can be quite powerful, but they are nowhere close to what it takes to training multi-billion
parameters AI models like GPT-3, for example.

Cloud computing gives anyone access to a scalable computer system that is only limited by the speed of your internet connection and monetary resources,
and in some cases legal access to these services.

These powerful cloud computers are owned by a handful of companies, which creates unnecessary risks for users (e.g. default on tech, finances or ethics).
The advantages of a cloud computer should not be constrained to a few entities that can decide about how we think and compute data.

And a cloud computer that is not owned by a single company already exists. Itâ€™s fully operational, accessible and permissionless: its name is Ethereum.

## Decentralized Computing
We mentioned earlier that Ethereum adds the capability to execute programs on its blockchain.
This effectively makes it a cloud computer that is maintained by an open-source community and owned by no-one.
Anyone can deploy a program and anyone can execute it according to its rules.
Such independent piece of software code is a Smart Contract like we have introduced in chapter 10.

This computer would be too slow and expensive to do actual calculations to effectively train an AI model.
But it provides the base layer to orchestrate computing and data resources in a more open and fair way.
