It's an entire ecosystem that lies in the depths of the Ocean. It's dark and mystical, but the creatures here are warm and welcoming.

Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how communication between data providers and data consumers takes place in a decentralized way.

Ocean Protocol provides a complete toolbox for data owners, data scientists and developers to securely publish, exchange, and use data.
 * It allows data providers to securely monetize their private data in full transparency while keeping full ownership.
 * It allows data consumers to access  data, which was previously not accessible because there was no incentive to do so, or the risk was too high.

The Ocean Protocol toolbox offers:

### Tools and Libraries.
Smart Contracts, libraries, and software components to publish and consume data services, build marketplaces, and develop other apps to privately and securely publish, exchange, and consume data. The Compute-to-Data feature is a core component of secure data exchanges.
 
### Standards to Interact with Data.
The standardization of data-related assets and their metadata is key to enable large scale collaboration and the creation of an open and effective data market.

 #### Definitions.
 An asset is the representation of different types of resources in Ocean Protocol. Typically an asset could be one of the following asset types:
 
  ##### Dataset.
  An asset representing a dataset or data resource. It could be for example a CSV file or multiple JPG files.
  
  ##### Algorithm.
  An asset representing a piece of software. It could be a python script using TensorFlow, a spark job, etc.

  ##### Metadata is Stored in a Blockchain Context Efficiently.
  Information encompasses the name of the data asset, description, owner, price, and other details like category, tags, creation and update dates, etc. It can also       provide a sample of the data.

  ##### Web3 Access Control.
  Traditional access control uses centralized intermediaries, where data owners risk losing control of their data. Ocean Protocol restores control and privacy by         replacing the centralized intermediaries with a decentralized blockchain network.

Ocean Protocol technology stack provides high-level functionalities to facilitate data exchanges for anyone dealing with data :
 * Publishing Data: Publish new data assets to the network to monetize them.
 * Consuming Data: Consume data assets on the network, for example to train a new AI model.
 * Creating a Custom Data Marketplace: Fork Ocean reference marketplace implementation and customize the data market for a particular vertical or to meet specific needs.
