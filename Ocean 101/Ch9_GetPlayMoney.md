# Chapter 9: Get Play Money

## Get Play Money from a Faucet
Faucets are places where it’s possible to get tokens for free. Usually, they hand play money, basically tokens that have no market value.
Many developers use faucets to start building apps in a safe and free environment before launching them on the main network.

Go to MetaMask and select Rinkeby Test Network in the upper central dropdown list. Your wallet address is the same as in the Ethereum Network,
but everything is free to play now. You may later use the same dropdown menu to switch to the BSC or Polygon network, which Ocean Protocol is also connected to.

On Rinkeby, the LINK faucet on the Rinkeby testnet  is the best faucet as the official Rinkeby faucet  is at times unusable.
You will even get some play LINK on top of play ETH.

Copy your ETH wallet address by clicking on ‘Account 1’, the default account created by Metamask.
Clicking will automatically copy your wallet address to the clipboard. You can safely share this address with anyone because it is
public and it does not control your funds (with your set-up only your Metamask and your seed phrase can control your funds).

You can also view the transaction on the blockchain if you search for your wallet address via a Blockchain explorer like Etherscan.

Blockchain explorers are public tools that allow anyone to search through the blockchain and check all transactions.
If you have a spare minute go there and have a look, it’s nice to see ones’ transaction make history!
