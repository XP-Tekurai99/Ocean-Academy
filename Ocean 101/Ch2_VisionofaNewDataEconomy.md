# Chapter 2: Vision of a New Data Economy
Many people have not yet realized how blockchain technology will disrupt their industry. Ocean Protocol aims to drive the change in Data Science and AI.

## Simplify Privacy Compliance for Organizations.
Personal data ownership remains in the hands of people,
while value creation from that data by companies is unaffected. It makes any process involving private data compliant with the most
restrictive data protection frameworks.

## Create New Revenue Streams.
Anyone who owns data, no matter how much and what kind, can earn revenue by granting access to those willing to pay.
This applies to individuals and organizations.

## Unlock Data Taps.
The ability to monetize data introduces an incentive to share data.
This increases the amount of data breaking free from silos, ready to be blended and transformed to create value.

## Make Data Available.
With more data available to use for Data and AI Scientists, data models will get more accurate, increasing the market value of data products.
The ability to easily search and find data from a global corpus removes barriers and friction to match data supply and demand.

## Liberalize Data Workflows.
With data and data services organized in markets, data science workflows can be redesigned from scratch.
Market actors will be able to compete and collaborate on each activity in the value chain.

## Seed the New Data Economy.
Data markets will be made 100% liquid.
While it is difficult to describe how the New Data Economy will look like, moving from an archaic ownership model to a completely liberalized economy is expected
to drive disruption.

The wave of change coming to data science and AI with the adoption of blockchain technology is likely to be as big as
the one that came with the adoption of the internet.
