# Chapter 7: Key Concepts of Blockchain

Understanding what is a blockchain and a Smart Contracts is helpful to grasp the value that Ocean Protocol can provide.

A Blockchain is simply a ledger that chronologically records the facts that it is programmed to record.
This ledger is duplicated across participants, and public, which allows everyone to check that its entries are correct.
This removes the need for a central authority to validate transactions: you don’t need to rely on trusted third-parties to be sure about what has happened when you can just see it for yourself on the blockchain. This is the origin of Bitcoin’s moto “Don’t trust, verify”.

Blockchains work like enhanced Google sheets. You can think of a blockchain as a Google sheet with universal read and write access,
but that can only accept new inputs if those new inputs are compliant with what the sheet was programmed to accept.
 * Only those with a valid entry can change the document
 * Old entries cannot be altered or deleted
 * Anyone can check that all entries are compliant because the blockchain is public

Bitcoin was the first use case for blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s blockchain is used to record monetary transactions in a verifiable and trustable way.
On that blockchain, only those accounts that have enough Bitcoin can send them to someone else.
This is trivial, but this was never solved in a decentralized fashion prior to Bitcoin, and this is the most important rule that was programmed in this blockchain.

Ethereum was the first ledger to allow the recording of not just transactions, but any kind of operation, making it essentially a distributed computer.
This greatly extended the foundation that Bitcoin had established and propelled blockchain technology to all sorts of applications beyond just a digital currency.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are permissionless: anyone can operate or transact on these blockchains.
Private blockchains exist, but they are limited in scope. And they wouldn’t be well suited to create an inclusive data economy: Ocean Protocol
wants to be accessible to anyone who has data or expertise, not just a select few.
