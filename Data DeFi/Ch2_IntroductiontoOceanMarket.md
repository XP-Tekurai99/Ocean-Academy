# Chapter 2: Introduction to Ocean Market

A data marketplace can be thought of as a directory of data services, where individuals and corporations alike can buy and sell data assets.
Let us explore Ocean Market, the first implementation of a Web3 data marketplace.

The Ocean Market landing page is your gateway to a world of data. On this page, you can explore the market and search for datasets,
access their details, sell your own data or data services, buy someone else’s or even “invest”, more on that last part later.

# Looking for Datasets
You can identify specific datasets with the search feature by using keywords based on their associated metadata
(e.g.: datatoken name, dataset title, publisher name, publisher public ETH address, associated tags, etc). Search results can be further refined with filters.

# Exploring a Dataset
After selecting a dataset, you will be able to view specific details about it. In the top-left part of the page,
you can view the data publisher’s name and optionally their 3Box profile which serves as a reputation signal. 3Box provides verification services for data publishers, more on that in later chapters. You can also click on the datatoken’s name (“WHEPEN-58” in the screenshot below) to view its transaction history on a blockchain explorer. This can help assess the popularity of a dataset. There is also a bookmark feature to pin your favorite datasets on the landing page.
In addition to a description, you can also download a sample if the publisher has provided it.

# Investing in Data
If you don’t have any data to buy or sell, you can still participate in the data economy. How? By investing in data.
We will be exploring this in detail in later chapters.

# Consuming a Dataset
First, you need to connect your Web3 Wallet to the Ocean Market, otherwise you won’t be able to interact with the blockchain.
Then, simply head over to the dataset you are interested in, and under the “USE” tab, press the buy button (you will be asked to approve and
validate the transaction which requires some ETH, and some OCEAN). Congratulations, you can now download the data!

# Turn your datasets and services into data assets
Let us head to the “Publish” section at the top of the landing page (and make sure your web3
wallet is connected to the market!). This is where you’ll be providing details about your dataset.

Be as descriptive as possible, the more information you can provide, the more trust you will build with potential buyers. On this page, you will also
be able to define:

- how your dataset will be consumed: direct download vs compute-to-data
- data access timeout
- pricing mode (static vs dynamic)
